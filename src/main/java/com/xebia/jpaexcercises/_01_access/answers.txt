1) In EmployeeWithFieldAccess when we give @Id annotation at field the default is FieldAccess so there is no need to specify the
  AccessType.FieldType.Access.It uses Reflection.

2) In EmployeeWithMixedAccess we can give the @Id annotation at field as the AccessType.FieldType is at Entity level and the
   AccessType.PropertyType is at method getEmailAddress so it will create a new column named email_address in DB and
   other column email should be transient.

3) In EmployeeWithPropertyAccess we can only give the @Id annotation at method as the AccessType.PropertyType is at
   Entity level. Its uses Getter and setter.
